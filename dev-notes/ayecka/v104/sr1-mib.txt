Hi Jose,

Yes, we want to provide the best device, for the NOAAPort system or for
any other application :).

On the current SR1 platform 8 PIDs might not be the hard limit, but
to add more we will have to remove some functionality, like drop or
simplify the counters per channel. Even then the PID number will not
go up significantly. So far nobody beside NOAAPort has hit the limit
of even 4 PID filters per channel... If there is a serious customer
who needs more than 8 filters, we will replace current FPGA chip with
a denser version and have more PID filters available.

SNMP:

1) counterCrcErrors1 defines an entry in a Profile, there are 2 profiles
per RX. So counterCrcErrors1 and counterCrcErrors2 belong to RX1,
counterCrcErrors3 and counterCrcErrors4 belong to RX2. To access the
filter counters you walk on counterCrcErrors1.1 for 1st PID filter,
counterCrcErrors1.2 for second and so on up to 4 per RX.

For current SR1 configuration with 5 PIDs counterCrcErrors1.1 -
counterCrcErrors1.4 and counterCrcErrors3.1 are active.

Note that counterCrcErrors1.x and counterCrcErrors2.x ( 3.x and 4.x is
another pair) will show same values since there is one set of counters
per RX while there are two profiles per RX.

crcErrors1 - it is a counter of MPEGs failed CRC8 reported by DVBS2
chipset, on entire transport stream. Our counters report failed CRC on
MPE section for a given filter, i.e. PID + MAC combination.

2) BER is a value scaled to 1e-7, i.e. value of 5 means 5e-7.

3) Packet counters - counterMpeSections1.x - it is a number of MPE
sections that were passed by the filter. If you subtract from this number
the value of corresponding counterCrcErrors1.x, it will be the number of
packet passed out. We do not have a distinction between multicast and
unicast packets passed by a filter, but in NOAAPort case all packets
are multicast.

Also you could use RFC1213 MIB,
.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry
(.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1). It contains aggregated statistics for network
interfaces. Traffic interface values are x.1, and management's are
x.2. There you can find counters for unicast and non-unicast packets as
long as byte counters for unicast and non-unicast incoming and outgoing
traffic. At this level all packets going out are counted and it cannot
be used to provide per-filter info.

Please let us know if you have any other questions.

Thank you, Andrey
