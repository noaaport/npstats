The configuration files are in

	/usr/local/etc/npstats

and the directory
	
	/usr/local/share/doc/npstats

contains documentation and examples to get started.

The web server is enabled by default, and can be accesed as
        
        http://localhost:8025
or
        http://<hostname>:8025

Depending on what is monitored, the following packages are required
and must installed separately:

	nbsp
	npemwin
	novramon	(novra receivers)
	net-snmp	(snmp capable receivers and devices)
	curl		(iemwin pool servers)

NOTE:
====

In this version, npstatsd runs as the "noaaport" user. If the previous
version that you had installed ran as root (that was the default in
previous versions) then there will be errors due to permissions.

The following directories must be owned by the noaaport user:

/var/log/npstats
/var/run/npstats
/var/npstats  (and all its subdirectories)
