The npststs daemon calls the manager through the periodic function,
in per.c. It requests the manager to POLL the devices pollers
and also to get the REPORT from the devices pollers. When the pollers report,
the manager calls the spooler and also the monitor.
The qrunner is also scheduled to run from the periodic function,
but it is not enabled by default (can be enabled in the configuration files).

The paragraph below is extracted from the file "collectors/lib/devices.tcl".

# These functions are used to uniformize the exchange of data among
# the various programs. The rationale is this. The data enters into
# the system via the manager, which sends the data to the spooler
# and the monitor, which can in turn propagate it further via the qrunner.
# The convention is that the data from each poller (called <output>)
# is a csv string. The manager adds the metadata (using the data_pack
# function here) and that is the string that is exchanged from program
# to program. So, every program receives a <pdata> string:
#
# <deviceid>|<devicenumber>|<devicetype>|<output>
