- This is a pre-release version of the

    Noaaport Statistics Tracking System (npstats)

Documentation and binary packages for some OS's are available from

    http://www.noaaport.net

This package is pre-configured to monitor the Novra receivers for
Noaaport reception.

NOTE:
====

Npstatsd runs as the "noaaport" user. If a previous
version that ran as root was installed (that was the default in
older versions) then there will be errors due to permissions.

The following directories must be owned by the noaaport user:

/var/log/npstats
/var/run/npstats
/var/npstats  (and all its subdirectories)

If this is the first time that npstats is installed, then the package
installer will take care of setting these permissions without any
manual intervention.

- What it is

Npstats is a system designed to collect data from a number of devices
from a number of sites, and send the data to a remote central
server for analysis, display and archival. It is particularly well suited
to monitor the noaaport signal and the performance of Nbsp servers,
and was built with that motivation in mind, but its design allows it
to be used for monitoring anything that can send data to a computer.

The system consists of the npstatsd daemon and a few programs that
run under the control of npstatsd. One such program is the
collector manager, or "manager" for short. A site configures the
manager to monitor a list of devices, and for each device
it specifies a program ("poller") that knows how to comnicate with the device
and query the device to read the relevant data from it.
Each time the "polling period" expires, the manager signals the pollers
to poll the devices. Similarly, when the "report period" expires, the manager
instruct the pollers to write the corresponding device's data.

After the package installation the default configuration is set
to monitor a novra box in stand alone mode, that is, the data is stored
locally and the status of the novra is displayed by the built-in web server
on port 8025. 

With further configuration npstats can run also in client mode, in which
the case the data is also saved to a file that is queued for transfer to a
central server. At predetermiend periodic intervals, the npstatsd
daemon executes the "qrunner" which is the program that examines the queue
and transfers to the central server all the files that have accumulated
since the last run. 

Npstats can also be configured as the central server that receives,
displays and archives the data from any number of remote client sites and
devices.
