Overview
========

**Npstats** is a system designed to collect data from a number of devices
from a number of sites, and send the data to a remote central server
for analysis, display and archival. It is particularly well suited
to monitor the NOAAPort signal and the performance of Nbsp servers,
and was built with that motivation in mind, but its design allows
it to be used for monitoring anything that can send data to a
computer.

**Npstats** is a system for monitoring the *NOAAPort* signal on a global
scale, with respect to signal levels and quality, performance
characteristics of the receivers, and software processing systems
such as *Nbsp* and *Npemwin*. If **Npstats** is installed and running, then
Nbsp can be configured to display the status of any of the devices
that are being monitored by **Npstats**.
