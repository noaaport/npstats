Overview
========

**Npstats** is a system for monitoring the *NOAAPort* signal on a global scale,
with respect to signal levels and quality, performance
characteristics of the receivers and software processing systems
such as *Nbsp* and *Npemwin*. **Npstats** can collect data from a number
of devices from a number of sites, and send the data to a remote central server
for analysis, display and archival. The **Npstats** binary package
is configured to monitor the status of the Novra S300 Noaaport receiver
*out of the box*, but it can be reconfigured to monitor any other device.
